THis is a Web Application that will, when given a certain monetary value and a currency type, will return the value of the monetary value given a different currency type. The application will obtain the currency exchange rates from the real world every 4 hours. The application will consist of a Web based Front End ( using a Java Framework --> Wicket, Play or Grails ) and a JAVA microservice based CRUD ( Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete ) backend using either a NoSQL or SQL DB ( decided by the Mentor after hearing the benefits/disadvantage of using each as presented by the group ). The application should be able to retrieve currency history ( by day ) for 30 days ( I will provided data for data before the project starts ). Implementation to include Unit test
